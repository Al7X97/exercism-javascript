# Exercism JavaScript — Ali

My JavaScript practice repo (Exercism track).  
I’m transitioning from Mechanical Engineering → DevOps/Cloud, and this repo captures real progress, not perfection.

## Structure
- `exercises/<topic>/solution.js`: my solution
- `exercises/<topic>/README.md`: what I learned, edge cases, time spent
- `notes/`: style guide + pitfalls I’m collecting

## Goals
- Write clean, readable JS
- Build problem-solving habits
- Track growth honestly (even failed attempts)

## How I work
1. Read the problem
2. Write brute-force solution
3. Refactor for clarity and tests
4. Document 1–2 takeaways in the exercise README

## Progress
- Started: Nov 2025
- Target pace: 3+ exercises/week
